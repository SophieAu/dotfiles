Inside of the Cover:
TA-W/P-I 201X-XX-XX - 201X-XX-XX
=> TA = my initials; W/P = work or private; I = roman numerals; 20... = start and end date

TOC
Date | Subject | Project/Component | Page


Back Cover:
Info about the hardware and software versions; including notes on when versions were changed


Pages are similar to the cornell-style; as in large margin for additional notes, remarks and the date

Every new topic starts on a new page (right side of the notebook) and has a date in the margin
Every new entry to a current topic has only the date and a headline without the page break


When taking notes on a problem:
- the "situation" of the problem: where did it occur, the context, everything leading up to it
- what was expected to happen
- what did actually happen
- how was it solved, jot down quick, potentially unreadable and wrong! notes
- a step by step walk through: what exactly triggered the error (why did it occur), how was it solved
