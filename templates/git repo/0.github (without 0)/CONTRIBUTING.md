# Contributing to \<Project\>

If you want to contribute in any way, THANK YOU! Please follow the guidelines below.

## Code of Conduct
The code of conduct is actually pretty simple: Don't be a dick.

## Questions, Issues & Bugs
First of all, please check if someone has already submitted a similar issue/pull request. If not, simply create an issue or create a pull request yourself. If you want to create a pull request for anything but a bug fix, talk to me first. Since this is my baby I might not actually want the new awesome feature you implemented. You're more than welcome to just for my repo and implement that feature in your fork though.

Whether you're creating a pull request or an issue, please follow the template and be as detailed as possible. This makes it so much easier for me and as a result I'll look into it sooner.

##Feature Requests
Again, create an issue and I'll look into it. However, since I do this mostly for myself and in my spare time, I might not want to implement the feature either by myself or at all.


## Pull Requests Additional Info
Before you do anything, make sure you check the current list of pull requests to ensure you aren't duplicating anyone's work. Then, do the following:

1. Fork the repository and make your changes in a git branch: git checkout -b my-branch base-branch
2. Read and follow the code style guidelines.
3. Make sure your feature or fix doesn't break the project! Test thoroughly.
4. Commit your changes, and be sure to leave a detailed commit message.
5. Push your branch to your forked repo on GitHub: git push origin my-branch
6. Submit a pull request and hold tight!
7. If any changes are requested by the project maintainers, make them and follow this process again until the changes are merged in.
