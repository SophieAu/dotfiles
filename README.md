# dotfiles-and-stuff
This is where I keep all my random (tech-y) files

At some point, I will create a table of contents here and write a short blurb about most files.

But not this day. This day, we fight!





#### what's gonna be in here
* dotfiles
	> all my currently active dotfiles, including .vimrc, i3 config, ...
* dotfiiles archive
	> old dotfiles that I no longer use but want to keep
* templates
	> github, latex, ... templates
* scripts
	> (mostly) shell scripts I've written
