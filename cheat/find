# search globally for file matching regex pattern
# locate is faster (and better) because it does not search the whole system but a database that contains all file paths and can look into root folders
locate <pattern>


# look for anything that matches the regex pattern
find <base path> -name '<pattern>'

# find all hardlinks to a file
find <base path> -samefile /path/to/file

# look for a file/directory that matches the regex pattern
find <base path> -type f/d -name '<pattern>'

# look for files not matching a path (e.g. checking that the files absolute path doesn't contain pattern)
find <basedir> -not -path '<pattern>'

# look for files not matching multiple paths
find <base path> -not \( -path '<pattern>' -o - path '<pattern>' \) 

# generally speaking, you can interchange -path and -name without a problem
