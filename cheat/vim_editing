# Vim works basically by doing this:
# <number><verb><noun>

. -> repeat last command
u -> undo last command


# Verbs
d -> delete
c -> change (delete, then enter insert)
> -> indent
< -> outdent
y -> yank (copy)
v -> visually select (enter visual mode)

# Special Verbs (always act on a single character)
x -> delete char under the cursor
r -> replace char under the cursor with another char
s -> delete character under the cursor and start insert mode
x -> delete current char
X -> delete char before the current one
J -> merge this line with the one below, add <space> as seperator
~ -> change case of the current char



# Nouns (Motions)
-> see movements
-> see search

# Nouns (Text Objects)
is -> inside sentence (=without trailing whitespace)
iw -> inside a word (= the whole word)
ip -> inside paragraph
it -> inside tag
i" -> inside quotes
i( -> inside round braces (other brace is fine as well)
i{ -> inside curly braces (other brace is fine as well)
i[ -> inside brackets (other bracket is fine as well)
as -> a sentence
aw -> a word including the white space around it
ap -> a paragraph including the trailing empty line



# Pasting
p -> paste right after cursor
P -> paste right before cursor
"+p   -> paste from system clipboard
"<x>p -> paste into clipboard x (any num/char except +/*)
# you can obvs add stuff to clipboard by using "<x> before the sentence
