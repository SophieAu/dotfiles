# To look at a file

# prints content of all files passed as argument to console
cat [FILE(s)]

# like cat but allows paging through file content, kinda like a vim preview (with the same key bindings
less [FILE]

# prints the first/last ten lines of all files passed to console
# optional -n X parameter changes "ten lines" to "X lines"
head [FILE(s)]
tail [FILE(s)]

# write standard input to file and print to output at the same time
<std in> | tee <targetfile>
# to append if file exists already:
<std in> | tee -a <targetfile>

# to get word/line/char/byte/... count of a file/standard in, e.g.
wc -l # line count, for other options, check the manpage

# to see the difference between two files:
diff [FILE] [FILE]


# write to files

# creates a new file with the output of the command, OVERWRITES contents of existing files
<command> > [FILE]

# append output of the command to the file
<command> >> [FILE]


# other

# convert a dos text file to unix
dos2unix [FILE]
